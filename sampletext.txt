hi today is 27april and i know most of how to push files on my own.

Commit 2: what happened is i made a Newbranch1 but to push i used the normal 3 commands that github gives, namely
git branch -M main
git remote add origin url
git push -u origin main

i am unsure what happened but i think the first command either switched me to main or it deleted Newbranch1.
